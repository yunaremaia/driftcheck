"""Regression guard: the docs build must publish a populated sitemap.

The hosted site at https://yunaremaia.github.io/driftcheck/ shipped an empty
sitemap for months:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
    </urlset>

Cause: ``mkdocs.yml`` had no ``site_url``. mkdocs writes ``sitemap.xml``
unconditionally, but only fills it with ``<url>`` entries when ``site_url`` is
set -- and a build with an empty sitemap is still a green build. That is the
whole failure mode: nothing was red, so nothing got fixed.

This module guards the config half, in a form the test suite can actually run:
``mkdocs`` and ``PyYAML`` are deliberately NOT dependencies of this project, so
a test that imported either would fail in CI's ``test`` job. It therefore parses
``mkdocs.yml`` as text and asserts the properties that make sitemap generation
produce entries.

The build half -- that a real ``mkdocs build`` emits one entry per nav page --
lives in ``scripts/check_docs_sitemap.py``, which runs in the ``docs`` CI job
where mkdocs is installed. That split is deliberate: this file fails fast in
every one of the 13 matrix legs without a heavyweight dependency, while the
script checks the artifact that actually gets deployed.

The helpers are imported lazily inside the tests so a syntax error or a renamed
helper here cannot abort collection for the rest of the suite.
